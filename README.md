<strong>Project Goal:</strong><br>To design and create a usable interface for the original Laser Tag system.

<strong>Tools and programs used:</strong> 
<br>Operating system: <strong>Microsoft Windows 10 or 11</strong>
<br>Programming Language: <strong>Java using JDK 19</strong>
<br>Prefered Programming IDE: <strong>JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA</strong>
<br>GUI tools and libraries: <strong>Gluon Sceen Builder </strong>and<strong> JavaFX</strong>
<br>Database hosting: <strong>Supabase using PostgreSQL</strong>

<strong>Testing Instructions:</strong><br>
Begin with having the current version of Java installed on your computer. <br><br>
Using IntelliJ as an example IDE, navigate to the project folder (example path, C:\Users\Michael Jones\OneDrive - University of Arkansas\Software Engineering\LaserHogs) and open. <br><br>
Once loaded, navigate to LaserTag.java (LaserHogs/src/main/java/com.example.lasertagproject/LaserTag.java) and run using the green play button in the top right corner of the IDE. <br><br>

The program will enter the splash screen. <br><br>

Now you are able to enter player ID's and Names, pressing F5 will start game countdown timer of 30 seconds and then switch to the play action screen with a game run timer of 6 minutes. the program connects through a UDP client to a UDP server automatically, the server and the client run as a class within the same program, so there is no need to run additional program. <br><br>
